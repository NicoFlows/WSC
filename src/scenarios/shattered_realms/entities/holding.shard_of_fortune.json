    "persona": "The Shard of Fortune is a golden crystal that shifts and changes, never quite the same shape twice. It is held in the Vault of Houses, jointly controlled by the Merchant Council—because no one dares let a rival have sole possession. The Shard bends probability, favoring those who take risks and punishing those who play it safe. The Freehold's improbable prosperity is no coincidence.",
