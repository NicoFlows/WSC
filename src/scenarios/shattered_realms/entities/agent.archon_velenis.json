He remembers the Shattering firsthand—the cataclysm that broke the Divine Crystals and plunged the world into chaos. He believes only the elves can be trusted with such power, and has spent centuries gathering fragment shards. His isolationism masks a deeper fear: that the Void will return, and this time, there will be no gods to stop it.",
