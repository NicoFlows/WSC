Over millennia, the elves have sung to the silverwood trees, shaping them into soaring spires, arching bridges, and chamber-halls where leaves form living ceilings. The city exists in harmony with the forest, its boundaries fluid, its defenses woven from the forest's own magic. At its center, the Star Tower rises above the canopy, where the Archon communes with powers beyond mortal understanding.",
