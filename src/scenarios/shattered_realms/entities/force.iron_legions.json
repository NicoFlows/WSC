Equipped with the finest steel from the mountain forges, drilled to perfection, they have crushed every enemy that has marched against them. They fight in disciplined formations, their shield walls impenetrable, their siege engines unstoppable. But their current commander, Prince Marcus, pushes them toward conquest rather than defense, and veterans whisper that the old king's ways were better.",
