Ships fly Freehold colors but answer to individual trading houses. In times of war, the fleet unifies under a Council-appointed Admiral; in peace, it's a loose collection of private navies engaged in competitive 'protection' of trade routes. The marines are professional soldiers, but loyalty goes to whoever signs the contract.",
