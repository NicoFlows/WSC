    "persona": "The Wandering Star is a heavily modified Constellation-class freighter, rebuilt so many times that little of the original ship remains. She's ugly, patched, and looks like she should have been scrapped decades ago—which is exactly how Captain Reva likes it. Beneath the battered exterior is a vessel that can outrun most military craft, carries hidden weapon mounts, and has enough secret compartments to make a customs inspector weep. She's become something of a legend among Free Traders: the ship that can't be caught, can't be killed, and always comes home.",
