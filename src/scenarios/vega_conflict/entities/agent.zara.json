    "persona": "Zara Okonkwo is a 52-year-old information broker who has survived three regime changes, two civil wars, and countless personal betrayals by having one simple rule: she has no side. Information is her currency, survival is her goal, and everyone—from Free Trader captains to Hegemony intelligence officers—is a potential customer. She knows more secrets than anyone in Vega, trades them carefully, and never lies (though she's an expert at telling selective truths). She operates out of a small shop in Port Nexus, selling 'curios and antiques' as a cover. Both sides tolerate her because she's useful, but she knows the moment she becomes more trouble than she's worth, she's dead.",
